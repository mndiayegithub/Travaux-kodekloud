a. On App Server 1 in Stratos DC pull nginx image (preferably latest tag but others should work too).
-> docker pull nginx:latest

b. Create a new container with name games from the image you just pulled.
c. Map the host volume /opt/security with container volume /tmp. There is an sample.txt file present on same server under /tmp; copy that file to /opt/security. 
Also please keep the container in running state.
-> cp /tmp/sample.txt /opt/security
-> docker run --name games -v /opt/security:/tmp -d -it nginx:latest /bin/bash
-> docker exec -it [ID_CONTAINER] /bin/bash
