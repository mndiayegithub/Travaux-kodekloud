Create a Puppet programming file news.pp under /etc/puppetlabs/code/environments/production/manifests directory on master node i.e Jump Host to perform the below given tasks :

a. Install package tomcat using puppet package resource and start its service using puppet service resource on Puppet agent node 1 i.e App Server 1.
Notes: :- Please make sure to run the puppet agent test using sudo on agent nodes, otherwise you can face certificate issues. 
In that case you will have to clean the certificates first and then you will be able to run the puppet agent test.

news.pp:
class install_tomcat {

# Install tomcat package 
 package { 'tomcat':
 ensure => latest,
 }
# Start tomcat service
 service { 'tomcat':
 ensure => running,
 enable => true,
 }

}

node 'stapp01.stratos.xfusioncorp.com','stapp02.stratos.xfusioncorp.com','stapp03.stratos.xfusioncorp.com' {
 include install_tomcat
}

Validate the file with "puppet parser validate news.pp"

On app Servers, "sudo puppet agent -tv"
