NOTE: You can use ansible_nodename variable from gathered facts with when condition. Additionally, please make sure you are running the play for all hosts i.e use - hosts: all.
Note: Validation will try to run the playbook using command ansible-playbook -i inventory playbook.yml, so please make sure the playbook works this way without passing any extra arguments.
