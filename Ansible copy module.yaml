a. On jump host create an inventory file /home/thor/ansible/inventory and add all application servers as managed nodes.
b. On jump host create a playbook /home/thor/ansible/playbook.yml to copy /usr/src/security/index.html file to all application servers at location /opt/security.
Note: Validation will try to run the playbook using command ansible-playbook -i inventory playbook.yml so please make sure the playbook works this way without passing any extra arguments.

playbook.yml:
---
- hosts: stapp01,stapp02,stapp03
  become: yes
  gather_facts: true
  tasks:

  - name: Copy from local to remote servers
    copy:
      src: /usr/src/security/index.html
      remote_src: no
