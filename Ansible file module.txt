a. Create an inventory file ~/playbook/inventory on jump host and add all app servers in it.
b. Create a playbook ~/playbook/playbook.yml to create a blank file /tmp/web.txt on all app servers.
c. The /tmp/web.txt file permission must be 0777.
d. The user/group owner of file /tmp/web.txt must be tony on app server 1, steve on app server 2 and banner on app server 3.
Note: Validation will try to run the playbook using command ansible-playbook -i inventory playbook.yml, so please make sure the playbook works this way without passing any extra arguments.
