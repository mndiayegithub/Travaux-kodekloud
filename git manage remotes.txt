The xFusionCorp development team added updates to the project that is maintained under /opt/demo.git repo and cloned under /usr/src/kodekloudrepos/demo. 
Recently some changes were made on Git server that is hosted on Storage server in Stratos DC. The DevOps team added some new Git remotes, 
so we need to update remote on /usr/src/kodekloudrepos/demo repository as per details mentioned below:

a. In /usr/src/kodekloudrepos/demo repo add a new remote dev_demo and point it to /opt/xfusioncorp_demo.git repository.
git remote add dev_demo /opt/xfusioncorp_demo.git
git remote -v : To view all remote repository 

b. There is a file /tmp/index.html on same server; copy this file to the repo and add/commit to master branch.
cp /tmp/index.html /usr/src/kodekloudrepos/demo
git add index.html
git commit -m "add index.html"


c. Finally push master branch to this new remote origin.
git push -u dev_demo master
