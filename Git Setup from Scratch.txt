a. Install git, set up any values for user.email and user.name globally and create a bare repository /opt/games.git.
-> yum install -y git
-> git config --global --add user.name natasha
-> git config --global --add user.email natasha@stratos.xfusioncorp.com
-> git init --bare games.git

b. There is an update hook (to block direct pushes to master branch) under /tmp on storage server itself; use the same to block direct pushes to master branch in /opt/games.git repo.
-> cp /tmp/update /opt/games.git/hooks/
.git/hooks folder contains shell scripts. These scripts trigger actions in response to specific events, so they can help you automate your development lifecycle.

c. Clone /opt/games.git repo in /usr/src/kodekloudrepos/games directory.
-> cd /usr/src/kodekloudrepos
-> git clone /opt/games.git 

d. Create a new branch xfusioncorp_games in repo that you cloned in /usr/src/kodekloudrepos.
-> cd /usr/src/kodekloudrepos/games
-> git checkout -b xfusioncorp_games

e. There is a readme.md file in /tmp on storage server itself; copy that to repo, add/commit in the new branch you created, and finally push your branch to origin.
-> cp /tmp/read.md /usr/src/kodekloudrepos/games/
-> git add read.md
-> git commit -m "add read.md"
-> git push -u origin xfusioncorp_games

f. Also create master branch from your branch and remember you should not be able to push to master as per hook you have set up.
-> git checkout -b master
-> git push origin master : Should not work due to the update script.
