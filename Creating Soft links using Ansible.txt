Write a playbook.yml under /home/thor/ansible directory on jump host, an inventory file is already present under /home/thor/ansible directory on jump host itself. 
Using this playbook accomplish below given tasks:
. Create an empty file /opt/data/blog.txt on app server 1; its user owner and group owner should be tony. Create a symbolic link of source path /opt/data to destination /var/www/html.
. Create an empty file /opt/data/story.txt on app server 2; its user owner and group owner should be steve. Create a symbolic link of source path /opt/data to destination /var/www/html.
. Create an empty file /opt/data/media.txt on app server 3; its user owner and group owner should be banner. Create a symbolic link of source path /opt/data to destination /var/www/html.
Note: Validation will try to run the playbook using command ansible-playbook -i inventory playbook.yml so please make sure playbook works this way without passing any extra arguments.
