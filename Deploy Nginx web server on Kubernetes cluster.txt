Create a deployment using nginx image with latest tag only and remember to mention the tag i.e nginx:latest. 
Name it as nginx-deployment. The container should be named as nginx-container, also make sure replica counts are 3.
Create a NodePort type service named nginx-service. The nodePort should be 30011.
Note: The kubectl utility on jump_host has been configured to work with the kubernetes cluster.
