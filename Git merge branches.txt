The Nautilus application development team has been working on a project repository /opt/blog.git. This repo is cloned at /usr/src/kodekloudrepos on storage server in Stratos DC. 
They recently shared the following requirements with DevOps team:
a. Create a new branch xfusion in /usr/src/kodekloudrepos/blog repo from master and copy the /tmp/index.html file (on storage server itself). 
-> git branch xfusion && git checkout xfusion / git checkout -b xfusion 
-> cp /tmp/index.html /usr/src/kodekloudrepos/blog/index.html

Add/commit this file in the new branch and merge back that branch to the master branch. Finally, push the changes to origin for both of the branches.
-> git add index.html
-> git commit -m "index.html"
-> git checkout master : Switch back to the master branch
-> git merge xfusion
-> git push -u origin xfusion
-> git push -u origin master
