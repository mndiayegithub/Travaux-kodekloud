a. Update ~/ansible/playbook.yml playbook to run the httpd role on App Server 2.

b. Create a jinja2 template index.html.j2 under /home/thor/ansible/role/httpd/templates/ directory and add a line This file was created using Ansible on <respective server> 
(for example This file was created using Ansible on stapp01 in case of App Server 1). Also please make sure not to hard code the server name inside the template. 
Instead, use inventory_hostname variable to fetch the correct value.

c. Add a task inside /home/thor/ansible/role/httpd/tasks/main.yml to copy this template on App Server 2 under /var/www/html/index.html. 
Also make sure that /var/www/html/index.html file's permissions are 0744.

d. The user/group owner of /var/www/html/index.html file must be respective sudo user of the server (for example tony in case of stapp01).

/home/thor/ansible/role/httpd/templates/index.html.j2:
This file was created using Ansible on {{ inventory_hostname }}
